In1dMsg
=======
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use In1dMsg;

.. data:: var sBound = 2**6

   
   Small bound const. Brute force in1d implementation recommended.
   

.. data:: var mBound = 2**25

   
   Medium bound const. Per locale associative domain in1d implementation recommended.
   

.. function:: proc in1dGlobalAr1Bcast(ar1: [?aD1] int, ar2: [?aD2] int)

   Brute force:
   forward-way reduction per element of ar1 over ar2.
   Causes every element in ar1 to be broadcast/communicated over ar2.
   
   :arg ar1: array to broadcast over ar2
   :type ar1: [] int
   
   :arg ar2: array to be broadcast over
   :type ar2: [] int
   
   :returns truth: a boolean array containing the result of ar1 being broadcast over ar2
   :type truth: [] bool
   

.. function:: proc in1dGlobalAr2Bcast(ar1: [?aD1] int, ar2: [?aD2] int)

   Brute force:
   reverse-way serial-or-reduce for each element in ar2 over ar1.
   Causes every element in ar2 to be broadcast/communicated over ar1.
   
   :arg ar1: array to be broadcast over
   :type ar1: [] int
   
   :arg ar2: array to broadcast over ar1
   :type ar2: [] int
   
   :returns truth: a boolean array containing the result of ar2 being broadcast over ar1
   :type truth: [] bool
   

.. function:: proc in1dAr2PerLocAssoc(ar1: [?aD1] int, ar2: [?aD2] int)

   Put ar2 into an associative domain of int, per locale. 
   Creates truth (boolean array) from the domain of ar1.
   ar1 and truth are distributed on the same locales.
   ar2 is copied to a set (associative domain) in each locale.
   set membership of ar1 to ar2 is checked on each locale by iterating over 
   the local subdomains of ar1, and populating the local subdomains of truth 
   with the result of the membership test.
   
   Apply v flag for timing information.
   
   :arg ar1: array to broadcast in parallel over ar2
   :type ar1: [] int
   
   :arg ar2: array to be broadcast over in parallel
   :type ar2: [] int
   
   :returns truth: the distributed boolean array containing the result of ar1 being broadcast over ar2
   :type truth: [] bool
   

.. function:: proc in1dMsg(reqMsg: string, st: borrowed SymTab): string

   in1d takes two pdarray and returns a bool pdarray
   with the "in"/contains for each element tested against the second pdarray.
   
   in1dMsg processes the request, considers the size of the arguements, and decides which implementation
   of in1d to utilize.
